# THE-PACK's Colossal Hog Maintanence and Event Finder!

This application draws from public information to find motorcycle and car events, as well as keep track of your favorite vehicles and list of parts. There is also a page where you can search for recalls for a specific vehicle.

## Let's Get Started

[THE PACK IS BACK](https://the-pack-is-back.herokuapp.com/)

As a car/motorcycle enthusiast, I want to keep track of kick-butt hogs and cars on an app, as well as view related events near me and to check for any recalls. The Pack's Colossal Hog site does this all on one site!

We used markers to open modals with relevant content.

We added a toggle to change the background from a motorcycle to a car.

Each marker that opens a modal returns information based on Eventbrite API and VIN API information.

The second marker opens a new page that allows the user to search for car recalls.
