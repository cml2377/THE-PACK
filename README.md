## How Colossal Hog works

We used markers to open modals with relevant content.

We added a toggle to change the background from a motorcycle to a car.

Each marker that opens a modal returns information based on Eventbrite API and VIN API information.

The second marker opens a new page that allows the user to search for car recalls.
